Single-Cylinder
============

Potential flow evaluation of single cylinder, single cylinder with vortexes and multiple cylinders. Cylinder definition using constant strength source panels.

Files Include:
=============

- singleCylinder.py  [main]

- unitVec.py  (contains functions for coordinate transformation and unit vectors)
- vort2D.py (contain functions to find induced velocity from constant strength source panel, and point vortex)

External Modules:
- streamlines.py   (plotting the streamlines)
